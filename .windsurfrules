# Letta VS Code Extension Development Memory

## Project Structure
This project is a VS Code extension that integrates with the Letta agent framework. It replaces the original Claude-based AI chat functionality with Letta-powered capabilities.

## Important Commands
- `npm install` - Install dependencies (remember to do this after adding new dependencies)
- `npm run compile` - Compile TypeScript files
- `npm run watch` - Watch TypeScript files and compile on change
- `npm run build:webviews` - Build webview UI components
- `npm run watch:webviews` - Watch and build webview UI on change 
- `npm run start:letta` - Start the Letta container

## Progress Tracking
When you complete a step be sure to mark it completed in implementation.md as well.

## Helpful Notes
- Always import letta sdk as `@letta-ai/letta-client`
- When implementing the letta sdk use `prompts/letta-sdk-documentation.md` as a reference

### Completed
- [x] Step 1.1: Added Letta SDK and Docker CLI helper
  - Added `@letta/sdk` and `dockerode` dependencies

- [x] Step 2.2: Implemented workspace agent mapping
  - Added getAgentForWorkspace() method to map workspaces to Letta agents
  - Implemented SHA-256 workspace key generation for stable identifiers
  - Added project block creation and agent registration with persona/project blocks
  - Implemented persistence of workspace-agent mappings in global state

### Next Steps
- [ ] Step 2.3: Register VS Code tools with Letta agent
